TODO support multiple simultaneous profiling modes (profiling event types)
  - async-profiler dump format
    - ATM, the collapsed dump format (what we're using) is not supported for multiple-event profiling
      - can it be supported?
      - see
        - https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler/issues/150
        - https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler/issues/357
  - data flow changes
    - ATM, sample snapshots are uploaded specifying event-type-dependent parameters per snapshot
      - so multiple-event profiling needs a dedicated queue+snapshot+upload pipeline for each event type used

TODO support per-thread profiling
  - might not be possible to access that feature through the AsyncProfiler class
    - see
      - https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler/issues/489
